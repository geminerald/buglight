## Design

As this is targeted at the technology sector the colour scheme is based on a 'Dark Mode' colour palate since this is common and preferred in this sector and is also prevelant in the imagery of
technology. The colour scheme was taken from coolers.co and is currently as follows (TBC):

* Rich Black: #00020e;
* Oxford Blue: #030a3e;
* Dark Royal Blue: #072e65;
* Blue Yonder: #4178aa;
* Purple Pizzaz #ff47daff;
* White #fefcfb;
